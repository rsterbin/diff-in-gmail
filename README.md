# diff-in-gmail
Quick and dirty bookmarklet for highlighting emailed diffs in gmail

**Bookmarklets are dead.  This will still work on Firefox, but I need to rewrite it as an extension, I guess.**

Using
=====

The current version of this bookmarklet can be found [here](http://www.sterbinsoftware.com/diff-in-gmail.html).  Bookmark the link at the bottom of that page to install.

Making Changes
==============

If you want to test the changes you make to bookmarklet.js, you can use `build_markup.sh > test.html` to create a file with the bookmarklet you can open in your browser.

You'll need to adjust `build_markup.sh` for your own environment, as the paths are just hardcoded to where I put the YUI compressor and bash.
